# bs-react-split-pane


A work in progress Bucklescript and ReasonReact set of bindings for [bs-react-split-pane v2](https://github.com/tomkp/react-split-pane/tree/v2). 

## Introduction

This is very early work in progress that I build to fulfill my need. But I hope it is a clean enough basis for anyone to participate (there are loads of components with hundreds of properties in Semantic UI React).

## Installation
To use these bindings in an existing ReasonReact project simply add the repository to your dependencies :

```
yarn add "https://github.com/voodoos/bs-react-split-pane"
```

And ask `bsb` to use it by adding `bs-react-split-pane` to `bs-dependencies` in your `bsconfig.json`.
